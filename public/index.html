      <h2>think it over!</h2>
      <p>
        Ten years ago, hundreds of the world’s biggest companies promised to end
        forest destruction by 2020. With only a few months left, they are
        nowhere near this goal. Instead they expanded into new areas of forest
        and savannah, converting once pristine landscapes into cattle ranches to
        grow commodities like soya and palm oil. We can’t accept empty promises
        anymore. We must protect and restore our forests and other ecosystems to
        keep our planet habitable and manage the climate crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forests are our life support systems. They help regulate our climate and
        support the diversity of life on Earth, but they are being pushed to the
        brink of collapse by companies driven by profit over the planet. We need
        systemic change to avoid climate chaos. Companies must fulfill the
        promises they made years ago. They must prove their products are not
        causing deforestation, reduce their meat and dairy use and restore
        ecosystems back to health. Remember, together we can change it!

      <h2>Company Advantages</h2>
      <p>
        Buying green products and services can increase your organization’s
        efficiency, enhance its public image, and is an excellent way to reduce
        your operations’ impact on the environment. Specific benefits include:
        Financial savings Green purchasing can have a big impact on your
        organization’s bottom line. Hundreds of environmentally preferable
        products - from office paper to janitorial cleaners, electronics,
        transportation and landscaping products - are competitive in terms of
        quality, while costing the same or even less than comparable
        conventional alternatives, over the life of the product. Many of these
        products also use less energy, water, fuel and other resources, saving
        additional money. Since environmentally preferable products are designed
        to generate little or no waste, they help reduce or eliminate the cost
        of waste and/or hazardous material management. For real-world examples
        of how green purchasing can save money, click here. Positive PR
        Organizations with a positive public image, brand and goodwill fare
        better in the marketplace than those without. As sustainable operations
        become more important in the public’s eye, implementing a green
        purchasing policy can go a long way for positive PR as it is good
        business practice. Improved employee health Your staff and the
        communities in the vicinity of your operations benefit from green
        purchasing practices through cleaner air and water. In turn, this helps
        you avoid costs related to worker health and safety, and can lower
        environmental risk costs. Environmental and climate protection benefits
        Green purchasing practices can reduce solid waste, conserve water and
        protect natural resources. They can also help alleviate climate change.
        For example, purchasing just 6 cases of 100% postconsumer recycled
        content copy paper instead of virgin (non-recycled) paper eliminates one
        metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), an amount equal to the
        emissions from burning 102 gallons of gasoline.
